## grading-assist

This program is meant for *University graders* using the *Moodle* website<br>
to intake assignment solutions which have grader-generated feedback files,<br>
unlike overwriting submission files.

The algorithm works by generating lists for feedback folders and files,<br>
matching these to each other, and subsequently placing the right files into<br>
the right folders.

By hand, this task usually takes around 15 minutes to complete.<br>
With this program, it's **~20ms**. Yes, *milliseconds*.
